@kaiser-roy loads [the hcsrn-vdw repo](https://github.com/kaiser-roy/hcsrn-vdw) in chrome.

maybe point out that I am logged into the site as @kaiser-roy

Scrolls down to point out:

- (skip over initial grid of folders/files to start with)
- we are looking at readme.md--a MarkDown file, which gets displayed by default.
- pop the menu at the upper-left corner, which shows an auto-created menu based on the headings used in the document.
- show the list of tables & the ER diagram--both shamelessly stolen from the xlsx.
- The ER is a little small--click on it to reveal full-size version.
  - so we can show images--nice!
- Note the pencil icon on the upper-right--this lets us edit this main markdown file right through the GH website.
- the main tab is `Edit file`, but note that there's also `Preview`.
- Note that the tables list is numbered but only in the display
- the first few tables listed are actually hyperlinks to other markdown files in this project.
- cancel changes and follow the Enrollment spec link
  - here too we have a useful image
  - scroll down to the usage notes--nice that we can use a real bulleted list here (unlike excel)
  - this file is actually long enough to make that upper-right outline menu useful--zoom down to the 'foreign keys' and then back up to 'subject area description'
  - note that there's no heading for the variable list--let's add one!
  - pencil icon
  - note that it looks a little chaotic--change 'soft wrap' in upper-right to 'no wrap'
  - much better!
  - add the heading '## Variable List' immediately prior to the table.
  - show preview--looks nice
  - scroll down to commit changes. Use short description "added a heading for the 'variable list'"
  - click `commit changes` & note that the outline/menu has changed to match. Easy!
  - navigate back to the main repo & then the [commit list](https://github.com/kaiser-roy/hcsrn-vdw/commits/main).  See the newly-added commit at the top. It shows who and when the change was made. Click the commit description and you get a lovely side-by-side view of the before-and-after. This time we just changed one file but if we had changed multiple files they would all be listed one after another.
  - navigate back to the commit list--note that it lets you browse the project as it existed at any particular commit.

So--the project maintainer--@kaiser-roy in this case--can make changes directly through the web. No need for any special software.

How about others? One of the nice things about GitHub is the ease with which you can collaborate. Let's see what that looks like.
